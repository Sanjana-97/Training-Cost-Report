# Training-Cost Analysis Report

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of employee training programs and their associated costs using Power BI. The dashboard delivers actionable insights into training performance, sponsorship distribution, and department-wise expenses, helping organizations optimize training initiatives and financial planning.

## Aim
To enable data-driven decisions by analyzing training data, highlighting cost metrics, and providing a clear view of company and self-sponsored training distributions.

## Tools Utilized
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For data visualization and interactive reporting.
- **Power Query**: For data transformation and integration.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For calculated measures and insights.

## Dashboard Highlights
The project utilizes a structured data model integrating employee, department, training, and cost data. The dashboard provides the following insights:

1. **Training Analysis**:
   - Total Trainings Applied and Completed under each Department Head.
   - Breakdown of Company-Sponsored (Marks >= 95) and Self-Sponsored Trainings.
   - Training Applications categorized by Module.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - Total Salary Distribution by Department.
   - Company-Sponsored Training Costs by Department.
